#  Practice building Sinatra simple Apps


- `boss` - Angry Boss play in Sinatra. There is a simple form with a field and a submit button. Anything you type into the submit button should be returned on a new page in all caps, with a rude message:
- `rock_paper_scissors` - Rock-Paper-Scissors game brought now to Sinatra. Just a simple form where you can make your decision on winning or loosing with computer rather just flipping the coin.


## Getting Started

If you want to quick run some the examples to see the code in action, and you have installed Ruby and Rails, run
```
ie.
$ cd boss
$ ruby app.rb

or

$ cd rock_paper_scissors
$ ruby rps_app.rb
```

Open in the browser the following link:
- for angry boss: http://localhost:4567/angry_boss
- for the game: http://localhost:4567
